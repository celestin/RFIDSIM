\item[Member \doxyref{Node\-Id::Node\-Id}{p.}{classNodeId_098f076be9769fb7a8d5b4e6c58ed1af}(t\_\-uint numeric\-Value) ]Eventually, this class should be modified such that the numeric\-Value can handle much larger types than just ints. Ideally, the representation should be at least 128 bits to handle IPv6 and maybe larger to handle RFID tag ID sizes. \end{description}

\item[Member \doxyref{Physical\-Layer::capture\-Signal}{p.}{classPhysicalLayer_06f60afa6a53f974fc3233d4f9e24173}(double signal\-Strength) const  ]When a full BER model is implemented, this signal can just be captured if its signal stength is stronger than the currently pending signal signal strength. The BER model will take care of whether or not the packet is received in error based on the SINR and rate. \end{description}
